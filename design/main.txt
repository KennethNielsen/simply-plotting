Simply Plotting
###############

This program describes simply plotting from an overall design point.

Main Program Design
===================

Simply Plotting is an interactive and extensible data treatment and plotting
program built around Matplotlib and Numpy.

Data Flow
---------

In simple terms, Data Plots will reach the data to plots by referencing Data
Containers, which in turn will be supplied with data once from a Data
Importer. Read more about these main types below.

Data Importers
↳ Data Containers
  ↳ Data Plots

Interactive
-----------

The program should make it possible to select items to edit with the mouse and
possibly add elements like arrows and text by mouse placement.

Extensible
----------

Both Data Plots and Data Importers should be implemented with a specific
interface and loaded on startup. This should make it possible to add new kinds
of each of these elements by simple implementing the interface.

Data Containers
===============

Data Containers will simply be a view into a lower level data structure like a
numpy array. Several different kinds of Data Containers can be invisioned
depending on the need. The first ones implemented will be:

 * Data view: This Data Container will not allow any editing of the data and
   will reprent it simply by a reduced ASCII version of the data.
 * Data columns: This Data Container will allow adding data based on data
   treatment of the existing columnes.
 * Spreadsheet: This Data Container will allow editing data by hand in a
   spreadsheet like fashion.

More details on the data containers design in the data_containers.txt file.

Data Plots
==========

The plots will be a standard Matplotlib figure, with the option to make
subplots. Each of the subplots can be of several different types including:

 * Line plot
 * Bar plot
 * ...

More details on the plots design in the plots_design.txt file.

Data Importers
==============

Data Importers should be able to produce data and metadata. The data importers
should include:

 * Text file importer: This data importer should be able to import CSV type
   data.
 * Database importer: This importer should be able to import data from a
   database based on several different data base layouts.

More details in the data_importers_design.txt.
